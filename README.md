## Currently Working on:

If you have extra time or want to practice your new React skills, here are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the tic-tac-toe game, listed in order of increasing difficulty:

- [x] For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
- [ ] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- [ ] Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
- [x] **Bonus: Add a "Cat's Game" alert if a draw**

## Deployment

1) When you are ready, execute 'npm run build'
2) Deploy 'build' on your platform of choice
